# Frontend Test

This is a simple react app that uses a [cocktail api](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

We will use this codebase during the technical interview to get a better understanding of your technical abilities.

During the pairing section of the interview, we will present you with two tasks in the form of tickets. You can then work through these two tasks with us as if you were pairing on the tasks.

There is no expectation to complete the tasks, we are looking for your comfort with code, communication and your thought process. We don't expect you to have perfect typescript memorised! Using Google and asking us questions is highly encouraged!

During the interview, we will need you to have the codebase running on your computer in a code editor you're comfortable with, and have the ability to share your screen with Google Meet.

Please ensure you can run the React app before the interview. Please send us an email if you have any trouble getting it setup.

### Getting this codebase running

This project was created with `create-react-app`.

First install the dependencies, you can use `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
$ npm i
```

or

```bash
$ yarn install
```

You can then either run the unit tests (don't worry if one is failing, this is part of one of the tasks!).

```bash
$ npm t
```

or

```bash
$ yarn test
```

You can also start the development server and see the UI.

```bash
$ npm start
```

or

```bash
$ yarn run start
```
